# Klaverjas in angular.

## History

I was playing a lot of klaverjas on my android phone during the last few months. Unfortunately, the app that I installed
was not very friendly to the battery life, which went down from two days to four hours. In addition, the ads in the app
exceeded my annoyment threshold by several light years.

I didn't expect the pro version (costing &euro; 2.44) would solve the battery issue, so I decided to give it a go myself.

## How to play

Well, there's not much to play at the moment; the only thing that the app can do now is shuffle cards, deal to the
players and display each players hand.

##How to run.

You need to install nodejs. Follow the instructions on nodejs.org. Currently I test with nodejs version 4.4.3; any
newer version should work, hopefully even better.


Next, you need to install ```gulp``` and ```bower``` globally with

    npm install --global gulp bower
